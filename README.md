# √ortex Slicer 🌪️

A 4-axis non-planar slicer, based on **Joshua Bird's S4 Slicer**, optimized for execution on Jupyter Notebook.

This project is designed for users who want a more streamlined execution and simplified workflow for 4-axis printing.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Enhanced Compatibility:** Optimized for high-end GPUs (tested on RTX 3080 Ti) to handle complex meshes and "Torture Tests" without kernel crashes.
- **Simple Execution:** Designed to run directly in Jupyter Notebook for easy parameter tweaking.
- **Standard Commands:** Works with `G01 Cxx Xxx Zxx Bxx Fxx` G-code structure.
- **In Development:** A standalone UI EXE version is currently being cooked! 👨‍💻
